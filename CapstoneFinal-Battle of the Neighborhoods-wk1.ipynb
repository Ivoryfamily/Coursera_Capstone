            "source": "In this age of convenient and efficient tranportation means, travelling around the world becomes easier and more common. In fact, people relocate around the world more often too with the globalization trend. \n\nWhen people move from one city to another, it is common to simply pick an area/neighborhood near work/school first, then move to a different area/neighbor if desired after settling down a bit. Moving, sometimes several times, isn't unusual in this scenario. It is obviously not an optimal process since we are only gathering limited/scattered information either via word of mouth or checking out a few nearby areas in person. Also, it would seem better to reasearch the new city and compare it to the city we currently live in to identify areas that might be a good fit for us in the new city, in advance. It would potentially minimize the need or frequency of relocations, which is a big hassle for those relocating with a family.\n\nHowever, most of the times, efforts to research a new city only offer the city-level information, for example, population, histories, economic condition, climates, etc. It gives the overall picture of the city, which is more useful for tourists but not for selecting an area for living. For the latter, it will be more helpful to glean and compare neighborhood-level details that affect the day-to-day living.\n\nIn this project, we intend to take advantage of the rich location data provided by platforms like **Foursquare** and the power of machine learning to undertake comparisons of neighborhoods in two cities, using New York City and Toronto as the example. As described above, applications like this could be helpful for people who need to relocate to a new city or people choosing between cities for their next chapter in life.\n\n\n"

The original source of this data is from https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572.\n\nFor Toronto, the list of neighborhood and corresponding postal code will be scraped from this Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M. Even though we could use geocoder Python package to retrieve the geographical location data based on postal codes, this package is unreliable (could get stuck in the process for unreasonably long time if using a while loop to ensure getting a result for each postal code). So, we will use the csv file containing the geographical location data for each of the postal code in Toronto that is provided for this IBM course at http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data.\n\nOnce we have the neighborhood data with the appropriate geographical data for both cities, we will then use the **Foursquare API** to retrieve the venues infromation within a certain range of the rarius (say, 500 or 1000 meters) for each neighborhood. Service and activitiy venues, nearby within a neighborhood, are characteristics of a neighborhood and reflect the convenience and life style of people living in the area. Hence, quantifying these venues into categories and the associagted venue counts are meaningful features to use for classifying neighborhoods into clusters/groups. Because our purpose is to compare the two cities, we will compile a combined data set for clustering analysis based on neighborhood venue features, and then examine the distribution of the clusters/groups between the two cities.\n\n"
